## ✍️ What I found interesting

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software engineering practice where developers integrate code changes frequently, often several times a day. I found it interesting how CI not only helps catch bugs early, but also improves team communication and confidence in releasing software.

The article breaks down the benefits of automation, testing, and the cultural shift needed to make CI successful. As someone working on collaborative codebases, I now better understand why tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins are so central in modern development workflows.

I found this reflection really relatable. The contrast between long, painful integration cycles and the CI approach makes it clear how much team habits matter, not just tools. What stood out to me is how frequent, small integrations reduce both technical risk and mental overhead, turning integration into a routine step instead of a stressful event. It helped me see CI less as a technical process and more as a team discipline that keeps codebases healthy over time.
