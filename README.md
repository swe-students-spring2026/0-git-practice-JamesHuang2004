## ✍️ What I found interesting

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software engineering practice where developers integrate code changes frequently, often several times a day. I found it interesting how CI not only helps catch bugs early, but also improves team communication and confidence in releasing software.

The article breaks down the benefits of automation, testing, and the cultural shift needed to make CI successful. As someone working on collaborative codebases, I now better understand why tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins are so central in modern development workflows.
